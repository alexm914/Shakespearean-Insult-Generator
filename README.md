// Shakespearean-Insult-Generator

// This is a basic array-based Shakespearean Insult Generator I created for fun. 
// Insults were sourced from a class worksheet from grade school. 

/* About this program
*  This program asks the user how many insults they would like, takes numeric input, and outputs the entered number of insults. 
*  If the user enters 0, the program does not take input and stops.
